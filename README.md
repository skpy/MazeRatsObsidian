# Maze Rats for Obisidian

This is a set of Markdown files containing the tables from Ben Milton's [Maze Rats](http://questingblog.com/maze-rats/) for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and the [dice-roller plugin](https://github.com/javalent/dice-roller).

The MazeRatsRollTable file contains all of the lists from the Maze Rats PDF.

The MazRats file contains blocks, loosely organized to match the organization of the PDF. You can use this file as-is, or as guidance for creating your own file to construct random results in the format you prefer.
